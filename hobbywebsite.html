<h1>My hobby - Cars</h1> 
<h2>The reason I love cars</h2>
<p>	Ever since I was a little kid ive always had an interest in cars. The first memory I have of driving was in my dads
1956 Chevy Bel Air when I was 4. Growing up watching movies and shows about cars made me fall even deeper for them. For 
me whenever im just having a bad day the best way for me to forget the past is to turn my car on and carve out the empty backroads at 2 am.
Its a feeling of excitement, adrenaline, and peace. Its just you, the vehicle thats at your command and the road, nothing else.
Everything that happens is a result of your understanding of how the car handles and knowing your limits as a driver.
<br>
	Another reason I love cars are its community. Nowhere else in the world will you find a community of such friendly and helpful people as them.
They really are just an extension of your family, they help you at your worst and having other people that share your same interest is the best feeling in the world.
From rebuilding an engine and having no clue to what you are doing to calling a friend for help because you dont know what the next step
is only for him to come and he doesnt know either but together you piece everything together and after all the frustration, after all
the yelling, and tool throwing you think you finally finished. you take a seat in 66 year old cracked leather seats and put the key 
into the hole of the ignition, depress the clutch, and turn. Then you hear it, after days, months, years of working on this engine 
you finally hear it. The roar of the engine breathing its first breaths in over 40 years. You did it, all your work payed off
now all there is is a big smile on your face and when you go to drive it you feel on top of the world and nothing could bring you down.
Its just you, the car, and the road.

<h2>My Dream Car</h2>
<p>My all time favorite car mixes in between the genius of German engineering and the beautiful styling and craftmanship of Japan. It is the porsche 964 911 turbo custom fabricated by Japans Akira Nakai who is a 
world renowned auto visionary. <a href="https://rwb.jp/"> This is a link to Nakai Sans Company.</a></p>
